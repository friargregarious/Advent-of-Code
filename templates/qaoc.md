## Quinte & Area AoC Guild

We're just a group of interconnected friends and coders within a few hours drive of Belleville, ON Canada. We use a handful of languages each, sometimes picking a different environment for each solution, depending on their strengths and weaknesses. I [friargreg](gregarious@Mastodon.social) started the server to gather a few people who would share in my epiphanies and aneurysms.

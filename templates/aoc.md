Advent of Code is an **Advent Calendar** of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## Quinte & Area AoC Guild

We're just a group of interconnected friends and coders within a few hours drive of Belleville, ON Canada. We use a handful of languages each, sometimes picking a different environment for each solution, depending on their strengths and weaknesses. I [friargreg](gregarious@Mastodon.social) started the server to gather a few people who would share in my epiphanies and aneurysms.
